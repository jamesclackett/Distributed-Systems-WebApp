* Open two tabs in your terminal and cd your terminal 1 window into the root of the project and cd your terminal 2 into the loan-services directory.
* In the terminal 1 window, run “docker network create shared_network”. Once the shared_network network has been created, cd into the application directory.
* Run “docker build” in the terminal 1 window and then in the terminal 2 window.
* Run “docker compose up” in the terminal 1 window and then in the terminal 2 window.
